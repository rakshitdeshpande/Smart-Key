Smart Key which holds the information the owner of the vehicle and with this key the vehicle can be started. The key will 
hold the necessary information which must match with the data stored in the database for the vehicle to start. Thus 
key-less starting of the vehicle can be achieved. This also prevents theft of the vehicle by sending a notification to 
the owner when the vehicle is driven by a thief.
